# Simple Yelp

This project is a basic clone of the restaurant review app, Yelp. This app has just one screen, but the data is fetched from the Yelp API. I have learn how to do networking with Android and the concept of asynchronous programming. 

The concepts I have cover in this project: 
* APIs and JSON data
* Making network calls to RESTful services with Retrofit and GSON
* Displaying a list of items in a RecyclerView
